# universial_facial_entry
A facial recognition system that can serve as a general purpose entry way for identity verification

# Requirements 
- `keras` with backend as your choice (tf in my case)
- A uvcvideo device or any video supported by OpenCV
- `OpenCV` python (3.4.5), numpy, etc.
- Public face library (I used ORL)
- Ability to read and understand this easy code :ï¼‰


# Results
- With an asian target face, system generates a confident model with in 5 epoch. 


Tested with Linux Mint 18.3 and should work cross all platforms. 

# Inspired by and partly ported from:
- Donny-Hikari/FaceLock
- Hironsan/BossSensor
